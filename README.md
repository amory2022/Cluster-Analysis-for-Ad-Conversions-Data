## Data Analysis Project: Optimizing Social Ad Campaigns

This repository contains the code and analysis for a data analysis project focused on optimizing social ad campaigns to drive higher conversion rates. The project aimed to answer key business questions and provide actionable insights for improving campaign performance.

### Project Overview
In this project, I utilized Excel for data cleaning and preparation, and Tableau for descriptive analytics. The analysis was conducted on a dataset consisting of 916 social ad campaigns.

### Key Business Questions
1. How to optimize social ad campaigns for the highest possible conversion rate?
2. Finding the perfect target demographics with appropriate click-through rates.
3. Understanding the ideal turnaround/decision-making time per age group to convert and re-target future social campaigns.
4. Comparing individual campaign performance to identify the best creative campaign for future runs.

### Project Results
The analysis revealed several important findings and recommendations:

- Targeting the 35-39 age group resulted in the highest conversion rates, followed by the 40-44 and 30-34 age groups.
- Focusing on the male audience showed greater potential for engagement and interaction with ads.
- Tailoring advertising strategies to males aged 30-34 and females aged 30-34 improved click-through rates.
- Individuals aged 30-34 exhibited the highest conversion rates, making them an ideal target demographic.
- Campaign ID 1178 demonstrated the best performance, with the highest impressions, clicks, total conversions, and approved transfers. Consider running this campaign again with modified audience targeting.

### Conclusion
This data analysis project offers valuable insights and recommendations for optimizing social ad campaigns. By following the findings and implementing the suggested strategies, businesses can improve conversion rates, target the right demographics, and make data-driven decisions for successful campaign optimization.
